Task 1: Description: Write a program that reads a file and finds matches against a predefined set of words.
There can be up to 10K entries in the list of predefined words.

The output of the program should look something like this:

Predefined word           Match count
FirstName                       3500
LastName                        2700
Zipcode                         1601



Requirement details:

Input file is a plain text (ascii) file, every record separated by a new line.
For this exercise, assume English words only
The file size can be up to 20 MB
The predefined words are defined in a text file, every word separated by a newline.
Use a sample file of your choice for the set of predefined keywords for the exercise.
Assume that the predefined words file doesn’t contain duplicates
Maximum length of the word can be upto 256
Matches should be case-insensitive
The match should be word to word match, no substring matches.
Consider a sample file with only the following two lines:


Line 1: Detecting first names is tricky to do even with AI.

Line 2: how do you say a street name is not a first name?



And a sample list of predefined words:

Name

Detect

AI

The match should happen only for the word “AI” in the first line and the word “name” in the second line.  The word “Detect” should not match.
